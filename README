MudCode, a simple MUD server
============================

Build dependencies:
-------------------
- GLib (debian: apt-get install libglib2.0-dev)
- libtelnet (build source from TODO)
- lua 5.1 (debian: apt-get install liblua5.1-dev)
- pkg-config (debian: apt-get install pkg-config)
- ZeroMQ >= 2.1 (debian: libzmq-dev is too old, build source from
  http://www.zeromq.org)

Additional dependencies to build documentation:
-----------------------------------------------
- texinfo (debian: apt-get install texinfo)
- texlive (pdf/ps/dvi only, debian: apt-get install texlive)

Additional dependencies to build from git:
------------------------------------------
- autoconf (debian: apt-get install autoconf)
- automake (debian: apt-get install automake)

Building from source is the usual `./configure && make && make
install' dance, but you'll need to run `autoreconf -i' first if you're
building from git. The server runs just fine without being installed
by `make install', if you don't want to install it.
