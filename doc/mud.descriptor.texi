@node mud.descriptor
@section mud.descriptor

The @code{mud.descriptor} table holds the primitives for socket
operations. Each client gets its own lua thread, and can block until
input is available. Descriptors are referred to by their file descriptor
number.

@defun mud.descriptor.close (@var{fd})
Close a descriptor immediately.
@end defun

@defun mud.descriptor.drain (@var{fd})
Put a descriptor into the @emph{draining} state; no new input can be
received and the descriptor will close after all pending output has been
sent.
@end defun

@defun mud.descriptor.on_open (@var{fd})
Your code needs to define this function. It is the entry point for new
threads. If you don't, clients will be dropped.
@end defun

@defun mud.descriptor.read ()
Pause this thread until the next input line is available.
@end defun

@defun mud.descriptor.send (@var{fd}, @var{str})
Send @var{str} to @var{fd}.
@end defun
