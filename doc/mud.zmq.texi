@node mud.zmq
@section mud.zmq

The @code{mud.zmq} table has functions for commmunication with external
programs, via the ZeroMQ messaging library. The server maintains an
internal ZeroMQ context and user code can create sockets registered to
that context. Lua code may also arrange to be notified when a socket's
state changes (becomes readable or writeable).
