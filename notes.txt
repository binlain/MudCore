Lua API:
self:will_echo(val=true) sets whether or not the server is
echoing (for password entry &c).

Timers:
All lines are processed asap. When a player thread yields for the next
line, an optional parameter sets the minimum delay before a line can
be sent.

ZMQ API:

REQ/REP: mud.zmq.handlers is a table of handler functions, which are
functions that take a table as an argument. These functions return a
table, which is converted into json and sent to the ZMQ socket. The
'name' field of the table is used to select the handler function.

mud.zmq.publish sends a message to the ZMQ_PUB/SUB socket.
