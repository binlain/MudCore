Lua API:
When a socket is closed, mud.descriptor.on_close(d) is
called. self:will_echo(val=true) sets whether or not the server is
echoing (for password entry &c).

Timers:
All lines are processed asap. When a player thread yields for the next
line, an optional parameter sets the minimum delay before a line can
be sent.

ZMQ API:
REQ/REP: mud.zmq.handlers is a table of handlers of some protocol
buffer, which is decoded into a lua table.

mud.zmq.publish sends a message to the ZMQ_PUB/SUB socket.

TODO:
- telnet echo
- telnet linemode
- telnet compress2
