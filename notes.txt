Need mud.shutdown() function.

Descriptors:
Append '\n' before sending out stuff from a prompt?

Timers:
Remove pulse rate, since commands proceed in lockstep anyway?

All lines are processed asap. When a player thread yields for the next
line, an optional parameter sets the minimum delay before a line can
be sent.

Lua API (timers):

mud.timer.register(delay, callback) registers a timer that calls
callback (a function of no arguments) after no less than delay
milliseconds. It returns a token which can be passed to
mud.timer.cancel. If callback returns a nonnegative value, it is
rescheduled for that number of milliseconds into the future. If
callback returns nil, the timer is cancelled.

mud.timer.cancel(token) removes a timer.

ZMQ_API:

mud.zmq.send(endpoint, msg, callback) creates a ZMQ_REQ socket,
connects it to ENDPOINT, sends MSG and polls it (as part of the normal
event loop) until a reply is received. When this happens, it calls
CALLBACK (a unary function) and closes the socket.

TODO:
- telnet linemode
