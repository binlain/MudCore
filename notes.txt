Need mud.shutdown() function.

Descriptors:
Append '\n' before sending out stuff from a prompt?

Timers:
All lines are processed asap. When a player thread yields for the next
line, an optional parameter sets the minimum delay before a line can
be sent.

Lua API (timers):

mud.timer.register(delay, callback) registers a timer that calls
callback (a function of no arguments) after no less than delay
milliseconds. It returns a token which can be passed to
mud.timer.cancel. If callback returns a nonnegative value, it is
rescheduled for that number of milliseconds into the future. If
callback returns nil, the timer is cancelled.

mud.timer.cancel(token) removes a timer.
