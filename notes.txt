descriptor - holds fd, buffers, character name, ...
states: open, draining, closed
A coroutine called on each input line.
Calling close puts the descriptor into "draining" state.
All descriptors are stored in the table mud.descriptors, indexed by their fd.

Timers:
All lines are processed asap. When a player thread yields for the next
line, an optional parameter sets the minimum delay before a line can
be sent.

ZMQ API:

REQ/REP: mud.zmq.handlers is a table of handlers of some protocol
buffer, which is decoded into a lua table.

mud.zmq.publish sends a message to the ZMQ_PUB/SUB socket.

Command line:

arguments passed to mud.args (a table):
- Arg with value: mud.args[arg] = value
- Arg without value: mud.args[arg] = true
- Positional args: mud.args[1] = arg1 .. mud.args[n] = argn
